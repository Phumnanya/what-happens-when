What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?

When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, the following sequence of events typically takes place:
1. DNS Lookup: The browser first performs a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. DNS servers are responsible for mapping domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The browser sends a request to a DNS server to obtain the IP address for "www.google.com".
2. Establishing a TCP Connection: Once the browser has the IP address, it initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server that hosts Google's website. TCP is responsible for establishing a reliable connection between the browser and the server.
3. SSL/TLS Handshake: If the URL starts with "https://" (as in this case), an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) handshake takes place. This process ensures secure communication between the browser and the server. The server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the browser, and the browser verifies the authenticity of the certificate.
4. HTTP Request: After the SSL/TLS handshake, the browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server. The request typically includes the specific resource being requested (e.g., the homepage "/") and additional headers such as user agent information.
5. Server Processing: The server receives the HTTP request and processes it. In the case of Google's homepage, the server generates the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to construct the webpage.
6. HTTP Response: The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser. The response contains the requested webpage's content, along with an HTTP status code indicating whether the request was successful (e.g., 200 OK).
7. Rendering the Webpage: The browser receives the HTTP response and begins rendering the webpage based on the received HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It parses the HTML markup, applies styles defined in CSS, executes JavaScript code, and displays the webpage's content.
8. Additional Requests: As the webpage is being rendered, the browser may encounter additional resources referenced within the HTML, such as images, scripts, or stylesheets. In such cases, the browser sends additional HTTP requests to fetch those resources.
9. Displaying the Webpage: Once all the necessary resources are retrieved, the browser completes rendering the webpage and displays it to the user. The user can interact with the page, perform searches, or navigate to other links within the Google website.
In summary, typing "https://www.google.com" in your browser and pressing Enter triggers a series of actions, including DNS lookup, establishing a TCP connection, SSL/TLS handshake, HTTP request and response, rendering the webpage, and displaying the final result to the user.
10. User Interaction: Once the Google homepage is displayed, the user can interact with various elements on the page. They can enter search queries into the search box, click on links, access different services (such as Google Images, Maps, or Gmail), or navigate to other sections of the Google website.
11. Search Query Processing: When a user enters a search query and clicks the "Google Search" button or presses Enter, the browser sends another HTTP request to the Google server, passing the search query as a parameter in the request.
12. Search Results: The Google server receives the search query and processes it. The server's search algorithms analyze the query, retrieve relevant search results from its index, and generate a response.
13. Displaying Search Results: The Google server sends an HTTP response back to the browser, containing the search results page. The browser renders the search results page, displaying a list of relevant search results, along with additional elements such as ads, featured snippets, and search suggestions.
14. Further Interactions: From the search results page, the user can click on specific search results to access corresponding websites or webpages. The browser sends new HTTP requests to fetch those pages, and the process described earlier (steps 5-9) is repeated for each requested page.
15. Ongoing Browsing: The user can continue browsing, performing new searches, visiting different websites, or navigating within the Google services. The browser handles subsequent requests and responses, rendering webpages, and displaying the content accordingly.
It's important to note that the steps described above provide a simplified overview of the process. In reality, there are additional complexities involved, such as caching mechanisms, content compression, redirections, handling cookies, and more. Nonetheless, this summary should give you a general understanding of what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter.
16. Cookies and Sessions: During the browsing session, the Google server may utilize cookies to store information on the user's browser. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites use to track user activity, remember preferences, and provide personalized experiences. The browser includes cookies in subsequent requests to the server, allowing websites to maintain session information and deliver customized content.
17. Security Measures: Throughout the browsing process, both the browser and the server employ various security measures. These may include checking for malicious activities, protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

18. Continuous Updates: As the browser displays webpages from Google, it may periodically check for updates to the page content or resources. This includes checking for changes in the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any other dynamically loaded elements on the page.
19. Other Features and Services: In addition to search functionality, Google's homepage and services offer various other features such as access to email through Gmail, news articles, weather information, and personalized recommendations. Users can access these features by interacting with different elements on the page or navigating to specific sections of the Google website.
20. Ending the Session: When the user decides to end the browsing session or closes the browser, they can simply navigate away from the Google page or close the tab or window. This concludes the connection between the browser and the Google server.
It's important to note that the browsing experience can vary depending on factors such as internet speed, browser capabilities, device specifications, and website optimizations. The steps outlined here provide a general overview of what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser, but the specific implementation details may differ between browsers and websites.
